# Statistical-Regression-with-R
This repository contains all R codes I have written for all my statistical regression projects.  
This repository includes R codes for uni and multivariate exploratory analyses. It also includes the codes for the simple linear regression, the multiple linear regression, the generalized linear model, the mixed model, the semi-parametric regression and the survival analysis.
